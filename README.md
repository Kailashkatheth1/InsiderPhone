# Welcome to the Windows Insider Program for Phones
A preview for Windows Phone experts

Windows 10 Technical Preview for phones is here today but it's far from being finished. In fact, it's fairly similar to your current phone (assuming you have Windows Phone 8.1) – just a little rougher around the edges and with a lot more potential to grow. Join the Windows Insider Program to make sure you get all the new features that are on the way. If you're okay with a moving target and don't want to miss out on the latest stuff, keep reading. Technical Preview could be just your thing.


Technical Preview vs. Developer Preview

Windows 10 Technical Preview for phones gives you a sneak peek at Windows 10 for phones. If you're interested in getting the latest software updates to Windows Phone 8.1, use Developer Preview for Windows Phone 8.1 instead.

Download and install the preview only if 
- you aren't installing it on your primary phone. 
  If you have a back-up phone, that's a perfect candidate for Technical Preview.

- Want to try out software that’s still in development and like sharing your opinion about it.

- Don't mind lots of updates or a UI design that might change significantly over time.

- Really know your way around Windows Phone and feel comfortable troubleshooting problems, backing up data or restoring your original operating system if something goes wrong.

We're not joking about the expert thing. So if you think APN is a news channel, Technical Preview may not be right for you.

Things to keep in mind

- Unexpected phone crashes could damage or even delete your files, so you should back up everything. Some hardware – like Bluetooth speakers – might not work, and some apps might not install or work correctly. You might also have trouble connecting to home or corporate networks.

- Your detailed usage and device data, including personal information, will automatically go to Microsoft and our partners to improve our products and services. See the privacy statement for more information.

What does it work with?

Current phones supported by Technical Preview for Phones are as follows:
- Lumia 63x
- Lumia 730
- Lumia 830

What features are missing in Technical Preview?

- Messaging is currently missing a number of features you might use in Windows Phone 8.1, including dual-SIM support, search, message drafts, sharing voice notes and ringtones, Bi-Di language support, international assisted dialling, spam filter, viewing all group recipients, reminders and quiet hours through Cortana, multiple attachments and GSM support. If you use these features regularly, you'll want to wait to install the preview until we get them into a future build.

- Cortana is only available in English (United States) for phones. In other locales, you'll get the standard search experience.

- The Rooms feature is not available in the preview. You'll still be able to get to your photo albums, calendars and notes, either on the web or by using other apps on your phone. You won't be able to see your chat history or send or receive any new chats. If you have important info in your Rooms chats that you want to keep, save a copy to a different device before updating your phone to Technical Preview. For more info, take a look at the Rooms FAQ.

- Some text in the preview will not yet have been translated into all available languages and will only appear in English. This text will be translated into all available languages by the time the final product is available.

- The Phone app doesn't have Dual SIM support or spam filtering in the preview.
